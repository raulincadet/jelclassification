jelclassification::find_jelcode("Literature reviews play an essential role in academic research to gather existing knowledge and to
examine the state of a field (Cropanzano, 2009; Kunisch, 2018). Researchers typically collect available
evidence on a topic or issue prior to conducting new research to assess the state of the already available
evidence. It is customary for management scholars – and researchers in related fields such as accounting
and finance – to justify the pursuit of a research question based on a cursory and narrative review of the
literature only. Many reviews leave it up to the reader to appraise why the authors included (or excluded)
some articles, books or conference papers instead of others – often, authors will rely on citing evidence
from journals that are judged as being of “high quality”, without necessarily considering a wider range
of evidence (Tranfield et al., 2003). However, a literature review that only offers an arbitrary selection
of evidence is often not fully representative of the state of existing knowledge, and the selection of some
studies over others ultimately leads to what is known in statistical analysis as a sample selection bias –
a type of bias caused by choosing a non-random sample of data for further analysis. Consequently,
narrative reviews often offer no comprehensive background for theory development and testing
(Sternberg, 1991; Sutton and Staw, 1995).
An important distinction between narrative reviews and systematic reviews is that:
Systematic reviews differ from traditional narrative reviews by adopting a
replicable, scientific and transparent process, in other words a detailed technology,
that aims to minimize bias through exhaustive literature searches of published and
unpublished studies and by providing an audit trail of the reviewer’s decisions,
procedures and conclusions (Tranfield et al., 2003: 209).
The rationale for systematic literature reviews has been well established in some fields such as medicine
for decades (e.g., Mulrow, 1994); however, there are still few methodological guidelines available in
the management sciences on how to assemble and structure such reviews (for exceptions, see Tranfield
et al., 2003, Denyer & Tranfield, 2009, and related publications). This is surprising given that there is
a large body of information available to researchers on various other scientific approaches (such as
survey research, experimental designs or panel data analysis) that rely on replicable and scientific
approaches to collect data and information. The idea behind a systematic review is to systematically
collect available evidence, and then offer an evaluation of the evidence against predetermined criteria,
rather than offering an unsystematic review of only some studies that are deemed as suitable by the
researcher (Tranfield et al., 2003). As such, a systematic review can offer a balance between
comprehensively identifying a larger pool of publications, and systematically identifying a smaller set
of studies that fit criteria for inclusion and can inform research agendas.
In this article, we detail methodological steps for how researchers can conduct systematic literature
reviews and offer examples of bibliometric approaches to visualise results. The article is structured as
followed. First, we provide a background information on the increasing interest in conducting
systematic literature reviews. Next, we review the different steps involved in conducting a systematic
literature review. These include: identification of literature for inclusion, data cleaning, analysis and
synthesis, and the presentation of results. In addition, this article discusses various ways for researchers
to use bibliographic mapping approaches for visualising research on a topic or theme and discusses
three different bibliographic tools. Our article highlights how authoritative literature reviews can
provide a rigorous and thorough assessment of literature published in a field that offers a review of the
existing body of knowledge and specifies future research directions.
2. Background
Academic knowledge is expanding exponentially. Every day, thousands of new articles, reports and
other materials are published. It is estimated that the number of scholarly articles surpassed 50 million
in 2009 (Jinha, 2010), with rapid increases in recent years due to an increasing number of predatory
journals that publish high volumes of poor-quality research, often in open-access formats (Demir,
2018). These trends mean that there is an unsystematic proliferation of knowledge across numerous
different outlets and academic disciplines. It becomes increasingly difficult (even for experts in their
respective fields) to keep track of new developments due to the sheer amount of information and
associated time requirements for assessing and evaluating new information, including whether any
given study is published in a reputable outlet. Researchers struggle to identify relevant studies on a topic
of interest, to critically appraise the content and quality of existing evidence and to synthesise available
results. For purposes of future research and publications, it becomes a challenge to select what evidence
to build upon (or not build upon) to advance a field of knowledge.
Systematic literature review can help overcome these limitations and help with several aspects of the
research process: establishing a context and delimiting a research problem; seeking theoretical support;
rationalising a problem and new lines of enquiry; distinguishing what has been done from what needs
to be done; identifying the main outcomes of (and methodologies used in prior studies; and avoiding
fruitless research. If the researcher is contributing to existing research, a key question becomes: What
is already known (and not known) about the topic or issue under investigation, and what are fruitful
avenues for further investigation? Such reviews can focus on identifying major research streams and
future research directions (e.g., Linnenluecke et al., 2017). In other instances, a researcher might wish
to investigate a new line of research (e.g., Cai, 2018, 2019) or build new theory. In this case, a key
question becomes: What is the new research field/theory, and how does it relate to existing fields or
theories? Literature reviews can be useful if a researcher is motivated by a lack of research on a
particular issue and topic; even though there might only be a few relevant studies, the review can still
be the foundation for a discussion regarding the knowledge gap, and how a researcher intends to fill it.
Increasingly, there is also a role for systematic literature reviews to provide insights and guidance to
practitioners and policymakers on the best avenues or intervention – a role that has largely been of
secondary importance in the management field in the past (Tranfield et al., 2003).
Generally, literature reviews can be structured according to several different criteria, and there is not
necessarily a ‘best-practice’ recommendation – different reviews will require a different approach. A
general distinction between reviews is that they can be author-centric or theme-centric in their
orientation (see Webster and Watson, 2002). Author-centric reviews go through publications written by
a certain author or team of authors one by one and present a summary of relevant findings (e.g., Author
A has published on the topic and arrives at the following conclusions; Author B has also published this
topic and arrives at the following conclusions, and so on). Such an approach is sometimes used for a
chronological review to trace back the origins of an issue, topic, or theory over time. A significant risk
with this approach is the descriptive nature of the presentation of findings, especially if there is limited
synthesis or critical appraisal of individual publications.
A more common approach is a theme-centric review in which the researcher guides the reader through
ways that prior publications have contributed to developing our understanding of themes, concepts or
phenomena of interest.1
For example, a recent review by Tweedie et al. (2018) summarises existing
literature on performance management in human resource management around three major themes:
literature on measurement and measurement error, literature on the social context of performance
management, and the integration of performance management into organizational strategy. Chang et al.
(2017) offer a systematic review on the topic of financial research on regulation in the Asia‐Pacific
region. The authors find five main themes in this literature relating to regulation: banking and financial
institutions, markets and trading, corporate governance, disclosure and accounting standard-setting.
Another example is the review by Lee (2008) of theories on corporate social responsibility (CSR) –
even though the review uses a chronological approach and examines the evolution of the concept over
time, it details various dominant themes in the literature and groups the literature accordingly. The
review by Daugaard (2019) offers another recent example; this review systematically explores the
literature on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment and reveals several main themes:
the heterogeneous nature of ESG investing, its costs and motivations, and its management literature
origins. A further discussion of the differences between author- vs theme-centric approaches is provided
by Webster and Watson (2002).
Irrespective of the approach (author or theme-centric), many authors often only review selected
publications in their literature review section and create a ‘narrative’, rather than a systematic review.
Systematic reviews require the collection of a representative or comprehensive dataset of available
research (Tranfield et al., 2003), and a replicable, scientific and transparent process to evaluate existing
evidence to minimise bias that results from the random inclusion or exclusion of studies in the literature
review process. The idea of a systematic review process was driven by research needs in the medical
sciences and healthcare, where the only ‘reliable’ way to determine the outcomes of medical treatments
1
It should be noted here that reviews can also focus on a review of research methods used within a field of research.
is to synthesise available evidence on an issue, such as the effectiveness of a cancer drug (Mulrow,
1994; Tranfield et al., 2003). While a single study reporting on a successful trial using a new drug might
provide some initial hope regarding its success, stronger evidence is provided by studies that pool
information from across trials with similar research questions or research designs. In the medical
sciences, a systematic review and meta-analysis of random controlled trials (i.e., the most rigorous form
of experimentation) can form part of a further systematic review that provides guidance regarding the
best form of treatment.
In the management sciences, where random controlled trials are often not available, a systematic
literature review of other published studies is the next ‘best’ form of evidence and requires the assembly,
critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies that address a specific question (Akobeng, 2005).
Unlike the medical sciences, management (and social sciences in general) have not developed standard,
agreed-upon protocols for collecting best-practice evidence; management studies, even on the same or
a similar topic, can vary in terms of their research questions, timeframes, sample selection, but also the
methods employed. To overcome such limitations, management researchers are increasingly adopting
meta-analytical approaches to create “super-samples” that allow the summary of information and results
from across studies (Combs et al., 2019). However, despite the availability of such approaches, there
are unresolved controversies about best practice approaches (Combs et al., 2019), and management
researchers continue to face significant challenges reviewing such fragmented evidence. In what
follows, we detail possible approaches for systematic reviews.
3. Towards a Systematic Review
As with all research, the value of a systematic review depends on rigorous methods and the clarity of
reporting, as well as on the application of scientific strategies so that possible errors and biases are
limited (Moher et al., 2009). Therefore, the fundamental idea of a systematic literature review is that
the review is replicable, meaning that another researcher can replicate the review process and arrive at
the same set of evidence and the same conclusion. A systematic review includes an exhaustive search
of designated databases (for example, Web of Science and Scopus), additional literature that might not
be available through these databases and requires a thorough process for analysing and synthesizing
relevant information. While systematic reviews are still not commonplace in the management sciences,
recommendations regarding desirable steps are emerging (Tranfield et al., 2003). The typical structure
of a stand-alone systematic review follows the set-up of a scientific article, including
introduction/background, a method section (defining sampling and analysis), a results section outlining
main findings, and a discussion and conclusion that details theoretical contributions or new research
directions.
3.1 Identification of Literature for Inclusion
Prior to constructing a systematic review, an important step is to clarify the topic or issue under
investigation. A good systematic review will have a clear focal point and focus on evidence that has
been published on a topic or questions. For example, Bailey et al. (2015) review the antecedents and
outcomes of employee engagement and focus on answering the question if there is a connection between
employee engagement and outcomes such as employee morale and performance. Such a clear question
focusing on interventions, mechanisms and outcomes in a specific context is advantageous for a review,
as it delineates clear boundaries (see Denyer and Tranfield, 2009). To help with shaping up the review,
a researcher might wish to form a research team or alternatively enlist the help of colleagues or advisors
to guide the scope of the literature review, the review process, and the triangulation of key decisions
(Briner and Denyer, 2012). While systematic reviews can be completed by an individual researcher, a
risk is that important elements (e.g., the selection of criteria for the inclusion/exclusion of studies) are
not subject to any review, which might introduce bias. A research team might help overcome such
limitations, for example, by including an expert on systematic reviews, a subject matter/content expert
and possibly a methodology expert.
An initial scoping exercise should be undertaken to gain a preliminary overview of the current state of
research and might prove useful even for experts in their respective area to map out a framework for a
systematic review. This exercise can include a broad search of the literature to assess suitable search
strategies (e.g., suitable databases/sources, time periods, search terms/keywords, language restrictions)
and to gain a general overview of the body of literature (see Briner and Denyer, 2012). The researcher
should investigate: Are there already existing reviews on the specific issue or research question under
investigation? In this case, a replication might not be warranted, but an extension or update could prove
useful. Are there many published articles on the topic? If so, it might be more fruitful to focus on
literature published in recent years (e.g., since a specific date), in specific journals or in a more narrowly
defined field. However, if the field is rather new there might not yet be many peer-reviewed articles in
academic journals readily available for review, but there might be conference papers, working papers
or other types of ‘grey’ literature that should be considered. Is the available literature mostly published
in one field, or have similar issues or questions be examined in other fields as well? A researcher might
have to consider interdisciplinary contributions to overcome the risk that important contributions from
outside ‘core’ journals might be missed (see Adams et al., 2017 for guidance on working with grey
literature in systematic reviews). Different fields place a different emphasis on publications in books,
book chapters or conference proceedings, such that some seminal publications might not necessarily
appear in peer-reviewed journals.
A next important step is to decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria. A researcher would not want to
incorporate just any random piece of information into a systematic review; consequently, it will be
important to consider what steps will be taken to locate relevant studies. A common approach is to
identify literature for inclusion through Boolean searches within established search indices, such as the
Web of Science or Scopus platforms. These databases allow a search for publications with pre-specified
keywords, for example, in the title, abstracts or keywords. However, before taking this step, a researcher
should carefully decide on the search strategy, including the selection or combination of keyword(s)
and database(s), the inclusion/exclusion of papers from other disciplines (many databases allow the
researcher to restrict a search to business/management, but this might miss important contributions), as
well as the inclusion/exclusion of conference papers/proceedings, books, book chapters, reports and
other grey literature. There is not necessarily a “right” or “wrong” way to make these decisions. To
ensure consistency, researchers can follow the search strategies of similar reviews. Further, and to avoid
bias, decision-steps should be peer-reviewed and documented to add transparency to the search process.
A detailed example of a search strategy is the review of Vitamin D supplementation by Martineau et al.
(2017) – the researchers provide a supplementary appendix that details the specific search strategies
and search terms used to uncover a comprehensive set of studies from various databases and other
sources.
3.2 Data Cleaning
Once a range of suitable studies is identified, duplicates need to be removed from the analysis. In
addition, studies that are not relevant need to be removed. “False positives” in the search process can
occur, for example, if an article mentions a keyword or phrase that was used to retrieve the article but
happens to identify a different or unrelated topic. No single study should be excluded because the
researcher deems that the quality of a study is low, or that there are methodological or other flaws – this
would bias the review. Instead, such studies should be retained and properly critiqued. The data cleaning
process can be conducted in a similar fashion to the triangulation process in qualitative research – two
or more researchers serve as reviewers and examine the literature that was obtained through the search
process and examine the studies for suitability for inclusion in the review. Typically, the reviewers
would check the title, abstract and keywords of each record, but sometimes it might become necessary
to refer to the full publication text to determine the suitability of the publication for inclusion in the
review. Any cases of disagreement should be carefully reviewed. Further data cleaning steps can
involve a cited reference check (examining the references cited by other studies to see if any
contributions were missed) and further triangulation of search results from multiple databases to ensure
that no important contributions were missed. Some programs (e.g., Histcite, see below) offer
functionality to remove duplicates and to carry out a cited reference check automatically.
3.3 Analysis and Synthesis
A vital step for any systematic review is the analysis and synthesis of the available evidence, and
depends on: the number of studies that will be included in the review; the type of research method(s)
used by individual studies (if applicable) and the quality of the evidence, and the chosen analytical or
visualization technique. For systematic reviews that comprise only a small number of studies not
suitable for any meta-analysis, the researcher can consider preparing tables to overview criteria such as
the research question of the study, the context for the analysis, the method(s) used (or whether the
publication is conceptual), the sampling method, as well as key findings. For systematic reviews that
contain larger samples of studies, the analysis will partially depend upon the type of evidence that the
systematic review has uncovered – if the evidence is primarily qualitative in nature, or if studies are
diverse in terms of their methods, qualitative techniques (including qualitative meta-analysis) can be
used to thematically code and categorise studies according to the insights that they are generating. Other
avenues are quantitative systematic reviews in which the researcher systematically collects primary
studies. If the available data allows doing so, the researcher may also statistically combine findings, and
offer an analytical overview using approaches for meta-analytical analysis (e.g., meta‐analytic structural
equation modelling or meta‐analytic regression analysis) (Combs et al., 2019). ")

focusing on interventions, mechanisms and outcomes in a specific context is advantageous for a review,
as it delineates clear boundaries (see Denyer and Tranfield, 2009). To help with shaping up the review,
a researcher might wish to form a research team or alternatively enlist the help of colleagues or advisors
to guide the scope of the literature review, the review process, and the triangulation of key decisions
(Briner and Denyer, 2012). While systematic reviews can be completed by an individual researcher, a
risk is that important elements (e.g., the selection of criteria for the inclusion/exclusion of studies) are
not subject to any review, which might introduce bias. A research team might help overcome such
limitations, for example, by including an expert on systematic reviews, a subject matter/content expert
and possibly a methodology expert.
An initial scoping exercise should be undertaken to gain a preliminary overview of the current state of
research and might prove useful even for experts in their respective area to map out a framework for a
systematic review. This exercise can include a broad search of the literature to assess suitable search
strategies (e.g., suitable databases/sources, time periods, search terms/keywords, language restrictions)
and to gain a general overview of the body of literature (see Briner and Denyer, 2012). The researcher
should investigate: Are there already existing reviews on the specific issue or research question under
investigation? In this case, a replication might not be warranted, but an extension or update could prove
useful. Are there many published articles on the topic? If so, it might be more fruitful to focus on
literature published in recent years (e.g., since a specific date), in specific journals or in a more narrowly
defined field. However, if the field is rather new there might not yet be many peer-reviewed articles in
academic journals readily available for review, but there might be conference papers, working papers
or other types of ‘grey’ literature that should be considered. Is the available literature mostly published
in one field, or have similar issues or questions be examined in other fields as well? A researcher might
have to consider interdisciplinary contributions to overcome the risk that important contributions from
outside ‘core’ journals might be missed (see Adams et al., 2017 for guidance on working with grey
literature in systematic reviews). Different fields place a different emphasis on publications in books,
book chapters or conference proceedings, such that some seminal publications might not necessarily
appear in peer-reviewed journals.
A next important step is to decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria. A researcher would not want to
incorporate just any random piece of information into a systematic review; consequently, it will be
important to consider what steps will be taken to locate relevant studies. A common approach is to
identify literature for inclusion through Boolean searches within established search indices, such as the
Web of Science or Scopus platforms. These databases allow a search for publications with pre-specified
keywords, for example, in the title, abstracts or keywords. However, before taking this step, a researcher
should carefully decide on the search strategy, including the selection or combination of keyword(s)
and database(s), the inclusion/exclusion of papers from other disciplines (many databases allow the
researcher to restrict a search to business/management, but this might miss important contributions), as
well as the inclusion/exclusion of conference papers/proceedings, books, book chapters, reports and
other grey literature. There is not necessarily a “right” or “wrong” way to make these decisions. To
ensure consistency, researchers can follow the search strategies of similar reviews. Further, and to avoid
bias, decision-steps should be peer-reviewed and documented to add transparency to the search process.
A detailed example of a search strategy is the review of Vitamin D supplementation by Martineau et al.
(2017) – the researchers provide a supplementary appendix that details the specific search strategies
and search terms used to uncover a comprehensive set of studies from various databases and other
sources.
3.2 Data Cleaning
Once a range of suitable studies is identified, duplicates need to be removed from the analysis. In
addition, studies that are not relevant need to be removed. “False positives” in the search process can
occur, for example, if an article mentions a keyword or phrase that was used to retrieve the article but
happens to identify a different or unrelated topic. No single study should be excluded because the
researcher deems that the quality of a study is low, or that there are methodological or other flaws – this
would bias the review. Instead, such studies should be retained and properly critiqued. The data cleaning
process can be conducted in a similar fashion to the triangulation process in qualitative research – two
or more researchers serve as reviewers and examine the literature that was obtained through the search
process and examine the studies for suitability for inclusion in the review. Typically, the reviewers
would check the title, abstract and keywords of each record, but sometimes it might become necessary
to refer to the full publication text to determine the suitability of the publication for inclusion in the
review. Any cases of disagreement should be carefully reviewed. Further data cleaning steps can
involve a cited reference check (examining the references cited by other studies to see if any
contributions were missed) and further triangulation of search results from multiple databases to ensure
that no important contributions were missed. Some programs (e.g., Histcite, see below) offer
functionality to remove duplicates and to carry out a cited reference check automatically.
3.3 Analysis and Synthesis
A vital step for any systematic review is the analysis and synthesis of the available evidence, and
depends on: the number of studies that will be included in the review; the type of research method(s)
used by individual studies (if applicable) and the quality of the evidence, and the chosen analytical or
visualization technique. For systematic reviews that comprise only a small number of studies not
suitable for any meta-analysis, the researcher can consider preparing tables to overview criteria such as
the research question of the study, the context for the analysis, the method(s) used (or whether the
publication is conceptual), the sampling method, as well as key findings. For systematic reviews that
contain larger samples of studies, the analysis will partially depend upon the type of evidence that the
systematic review has uncovered – if the evidence is primarily qualitative in nature, or if studies are
diverse in terms of their methods, qualitative techniques (including qualitative meta-analysis) can be
used to thematically code and categorise studies according to the insights that they are generating. Other
avenues are quantitative systematic reviews in which the researcher systematically collects primary
studies. If the available data allows doing so, the researcher may also statistically combine findings, and
offer an analytical overview using approaches for meta-analytical analysis (e.g., meta‐analytic structural
equation modelling or meta‐analytic regression analysis) (Combs et al., 2019). ")
